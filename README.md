# JupiterToys

This repository is a small testing framwork and test class for the Juniper Toys website.
The tests are contained within TC_Planit.rb and utilise page objects and a support module.
The tests will run against both of the following application URL's.

http://jupiter.cloud.planittesting.com 
https://jupiter2.cloud.planittesting.com/#/shop

The code is written in Ruby and mainly utilises the selenium-webdriver gem.

## Installation

First install a code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win).

Then install the [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) language.
I am using windows so I downloaded an installer (without the devkit) and ran it. For example [rubyinstaller-3.1.2-1-x64.exe](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-3.1.2-1/rubyinstaller-3.1.2-1-x64.exe)
